![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ankur-gupta/docker-base-ml?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fankur-gupta%2Fdocker-base-ml%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FLICENSE)

## Deprecation
* [ml-pytorch](https://github.com/ankur-gupta/docker-base-ml/pkgs/container/ml-pytorch) is no longer being devleoped and will be removed. Please switch to [docker-base-ml](https://github.com/users/ankur-gupta/packages/container/package/docker-base-ml). 

## Use cases
You should use this image if you
* need to run PyTorch on an Nvidia CUDA 11.8.0 GPU device
* want to use fish shell
* don't want to re-install a virtualenv everytime
* want to run large ML training job on a remote server via SSH
* want to deploy a base image to a cloud computing provider (eg: runpod.io)

You shouldn't use this image
* if you want to run PyTorch on Apple Silicon
* in an otherwise unsecured environment (because it adds a `sudo`-privileged user with plaintext password)
* if you want to use bash shell
* if you want to run jupyter notebook
* if you need a pinned python virtualenv


## Features
### `Dockerfile`
This image has the following installed
* `git`, `rsync`, `ssh`, and other Linux utilities
* [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/) is set to default for the user `neo` (see below)
* `python3` and `pip`
* `python3.9` and `pip`
* updated `conda` base environment
* [Virtualfish](https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish) is available as `vf`
* A `vf` environment called `pytorch` which contains
  * `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  * `scikit-learn`, `scipy`
  * `torch`, `torchtext`
  * `transformers`, `datasets`, `sentencepiece`
  * `wandb`, `wbutils`
  * `ipython`, `jupyter`
  * `pytest`, `coverage`, and more

Use `pytorch` virtualenv as follows
```shell
# You should be in the (default) fish shell (not bash)
vf activate pytorch
ipython
# Run your python code
# Exit ipython
vf deactivate
```

### User
This image creates a `sudo`-privileged user for you. You should be able to
do everything (including installing packages using `apt-get`) as this user
without having to become `root`.

| Key      | Value        |
|----------|--------------|
| Username | `neo`        |
| Password | `agentsmith` |


## Get the image
### From Docker Hub
```shell
docker pull ankurio/docker-base-ml:latest
docker run -it ankurio/docker-base-ml:latest /usr/bin/fish
```

### Clone from GitHub Packages
```shell
# You need to login even though the image is public
docker login docker.pkg.github.com
Username: # type your GitHub username
Password: # type your GitHub password (not token)
# Login Succeeded  <- Success!

# Now, you can pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/ankur-gupta/docker-base-ml:latest
docker run -it ghcr.io/ankur-gupta/docker-base-ml /usr/bin/fish
```

### Build it yourself
Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build it yourself. It will take ~10 minutes to build the first time.
```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:ankur-gupta/docker-base-ml.git

# From $REPO_ROOT
cd $REPO_ROOT
docker build . -t docker-base-ml
docker run -it docker-base-ml /usr/bin/fish
```

## Usage
```shell
# This command assumes that you pulled the image from DockerHub. Modify if you got the image
# in other ways.
docker run -it ankurio/docker-base-ml:latest /usr/bin/fish

# Execute these within the docker container
# Use the installed `pytorch` virtualenv
neo@5e50bd3d637b ~> vf activate pytorch
neo@5e50bd3d637b ~> (pytorch) ipython
# Python 3.10.12 (main, Jun 11 2023, 05:26:28) [GCC 11.4.0]
# Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
# IPython 8.14.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
In [1]: import torch
In [2]: torch.zeros(3)
Out[2]: tensor([0., 0., 0.])
# Run your pytorch code here
# ...
# ...

# Exit ipython
exit  # or press Control+D

# Deactivate virtualenv
vf deactivate

# Exit the docker container
exit  # or press Control+D
```


## Docker tips
### Debugging build errors
A `RUN echo "print something"` line in `Dockerfile` will be useful if you use ["plain progress"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67548336/4383754)
```shell
docker build . -t docker-base-ml --progress=plain
```

### Clean all containers and images
This does not delete the docker cache. From this
[StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55499079/4383754).

```shell
# Delete all containers - do this first!
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Delete all images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```

### No space left on device
If you encounter this type of error,
```
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to register layer: write /usr/local/cuda-11.8/targets/sbsa-linux/lib/libcublasLt_static.a: no space left on device
```
it means that you may need to free disk space. You can do it using these commands.

```shell
docker system prune -a  # this will delete the cache
# WARNING! This will remove:
#   - all stopped containers
#   - all networks not used by at least one container
#   - all images without at least one container associated to them
#   - all build cache

# Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
# Deleted build cache objects:
# kukqetqe618pmdgf5vz1npyn6
# ...
# gdculirrh0mr1g2x2qa7llunk
# Total reclaimed space: 21.19GB

docker volume prune
# WARNING! This will remove anonymous local volumes not used by at least one container.
# Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
# Total reclaimed space: 0B

docker network prune
# WARNING! This will remove all custom networks not used by at least one container.
# Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
```

You can check docker's space usage like this
```shell
docker system df
# TYPE            TOTAL     ACTIVE    SIZE      RECLAIMABLE
# Images          2         1         7.192GB   7.192GB (100%)
# Containers      1         0         1.621kB   1.621kB (100%)
# Local Volumes   0         0         0B        0B
# Build Cache     88        3         11.83kB   10.54kB
```
